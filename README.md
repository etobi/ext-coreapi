## TYPO3 Extension 'coreapi'

The EXT:coreapi should provide a simple to use API for common core features. Goal is to be able to do the most common tasks by CLI instead of doing it in the backend/browser.

Beside of CLI commands, EXT:coreapi provides service classes, which can be used in your own implementation/extension.

### CLI call: ###

Make sure you have a backend user called `_cli_lowlevel`

If you want to use the cache clearing commands, you need to add the following snippet to the TSconfig field of this backend user:

	options.clearCache.all=1
	options.clearCache.pages=1

#### TYPO3 4.7+ ####
If you are using TYPO3 4.7+, you can use the awesome CommandController of Extbase.

This will show you all available calls
	./typo3/cli_dispatch.phpsh extbase help

#### TYPO3 4.6 and below ####
If you are using 4.5 or 4.6, you can still use the extension with a call like
	./typo3/cli_dispatch.phpsh coreapi cache:clearallcaches
